# Reproducibility of the C3S Atlas Application visual products


This second chapter contains several notebooks to reproduce and extend parts of the figures and products provided by the [C3S Atlas Application](https://atlas.climate.copernicus.eu), from global and regional maps to (regional) time series, climate stripes, for pre-defined or customized regions. Some auxiliary elements, such as the calculation of Global Waming Levels (GWLs) are also illsutrated.  

Table 1 lists the notebooks included in this chapter, which build upon the [C3S Atlas Dataset](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.h35hb680) described in the first chapter of this book.

|  [spatial_map.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/spatial_map.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing spatial maps of climatologies or changes for recent and future periods across emission scenarios or for different Global Warming Levels (GWL), including the calculation and display of robustness following the IPCC AR6 WGI methodology.
|  [time_series.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/time_series.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional time series for pre-defined regions.
|  [climate_stripe.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/climate_stripes.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional climate stripes for pre-defined regions.
|  [seasonal_stripe.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/seasonal_stripes.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional seasonal stripes for pre-defined regions.
|  [annual_cycle.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/annual_cycle.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook for reproducing regional annual cycles for pre-defined regions.
|  [customized_regions.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/customized_regions.ipynb) | Jupyter Auxiliary notebook with examples of how to produce regional results for customized regions defined in machine-readable formats (e.g. geojson).
|  [GWLs.ipynb](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/blob/main/book/notebooks/GWLs.ipynb) | Auxiliary Jupyter Notebook illustrating the calculation of Global Warming Levels (GWLs), following the IPCC AR6 WGI methodology. This is used by the previous notebooks for calculating changes for different warming levels.
