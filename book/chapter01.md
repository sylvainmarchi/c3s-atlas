# Reproducibility of the C3S Atlas Dataset  

This initial chapter provides several notebooks designed to reproduce the calculation of gridded data (variables and indices, see Table 3) included in the [C3S Atlas Dataset](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.h35hb680). These notebooks promote reusability and enable rapid development of customized products tailored to specific applications. **Note, however, that the notebook examples cover only specific regions and subsets and cannot be used directly to replicate the entire dataset, as it requires an optimized workflow executed on HPC infrastructure.**

Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the data production workflow, emphasizing the following processing steps:

- Download climate data from the C3S-CDS using the CDS API.
- Download the reference datasets (only for bias adjusted indices).
- Perform data homogenization to ensure the same calendar time, coordinate names, variable units, dimension order, among other things.
- Interpolate both the projections and the reference dataset to a regular-common grid using conservative remapping (only for bias adjusted indices).
- Calculate the index.
- Perform temporal aggregation.
- Interpolate to a regular-common grid using conservative remapping (not necessary for bias adjusted indices).

**Table 3**. Description of the climate variables and indices included in the second version of the C3S Atlas. The first four columns indicate the code, name, units, and description of the indices. The last column includes the Python command used to compute the C3S Atlas indices from daily data, either using xarray, xclim or [in-house](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/c3s-atlas/tree/main/c3s_atlas). Input variables used to compute each index are defined with its code name (e.g. t for daily mean air temperature) functions. 

### Bias corrected indices

For threshold-dependent indices the C3S Atlas includes both raw and bias-adjusted information, using two alternative methods: the simple [LinearScaling](https://ibicus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/debias.html#ibicus.debias.LinearScaling) ([Douglas Maraun 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40641-016-0050-x)) and more advanced trend preserving method [ISIMIP](https://ibicus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/debias.html#ibicus.debias.ISIMIP) ([Lange 2019](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3055-2019)).
